# Low_Light_Enhancement_Using_CNN
This repository implements MCIEN (Multi-Scale Concat Image Enhancement Network), a CNN-based approach for low-light image enhancement. By using multi-scale convolutions and feature fusion, it recovers clear details, natural colors, and contrast. Trained on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, MCIEN achieves superior visual and quantitative results.
